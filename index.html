        <h2>My name is <strong>First</strong></h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Patcharapol Phantawee. I am a 12th-grade student studying in the English-Chinese program at
          Roi Et Wittayalai School. I am interested in pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer
          Science.

          My passion for computer languages began when I was in elementary school, watching YouTubers who created
          programming content. This sparked my fascination, but due to my limited English proficiency at the time, I
          chose to enroll in the English-Chinese program in high school. Although this temporarily diverted me from
          programming, I continued to practice and develop my skills. Studying English and Chinese while simultaneously
          learning programming has been a significant challenge for me. The Chinese program requires memorizing
          extensive vocabulary, while the English program demands practice in speaking, reading, and writing. Despite my
          limited programming experience, I am highly motivated to learn and confident that Khon Kaen University will
          help me reach my full potential.

          The Faculty of Computer Science at Khon Kaen University is renowned in northeastern Thailand for its modern
          curriculum and ability to develop talented individuals who meet the demands of the job market. The faculty
          collaborates with leading technology companies both domestically and internationally, providing students with
          opportunities to intern at prestigious organizations and gain hands-on experience. Moreover, the faculty
          boasts highly qualified professors specializing in computer science and information technology, many of whom
          have international experience and are globally recognized researchers.

          I firmly believe that my knowledge, abilities, and dedication will greatly benefit Khon Kaen University. I
          will adhere to professional ethics, continuously learn new things, and excel at solving problems using logical
          and creative thinking. I possess strong communication skills, teamwork abilities, and leadership qualities. My
          ultimate goal in life is to become a programmer.</p>

        <h2><strong>Mini</strong> Camp</h2>
        <p>I participated in this activity on April 9, 2024. The entire activity took 3 days to complete. On the 3rd
          day, we were allowed to choose our own learning track. I therefore chose the one related to the Faculty of
          Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence (ปัญญาประดิษฐ์).
